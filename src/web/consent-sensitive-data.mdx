## Potential sensitive data

No potential sensitive data are recorded. This means that inputs, ip addresses, on-page emails and long numbers are **not recorded by default**.

## Consent

You are obligated to get visitors' consent when you want to store potential sensitive data on our end. Unless covered by your Terms of Service.

## API

Use the `record` API calls after consent is handled.
These should be called always after `init` call.

### Form inputs

Use `record` with `{ forms: true }` or `{ forms: false }` attributes to start or stop recording of all form inputs.

<Code
	kind="example"
	snippets={{
		javascript: `
<script>
  smartlook('record', { forms: true });
</script>
`,
	}}
/>

<Code
	kind="example"
	snippets={{
		javascript: `
<script>
  smartlook('record', { forms: false });
</script>
`,
	}}
/>

### IP address

Use `record` with `{ ips: true }` attribute to start recording of ip address.

<Code
	kind="example"
	snippets={{
		javascript: `
<script>
  smartlook('record', { ips: true });
</script>
`,
	}}
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">
	{`
Recording of IP address can't be stopped once started.
`}
</TextBlock>

### On-page emails

Use `record` with `{ emails: true }` or `{ emails: false }` attributes to start or stop recording of on-page emails.

<Code
	kind="example"
	snippets={{
		javascript: `
<script>
  smartlook('record', { emails: true });
</script>
`,
	}}
/>

<Code
	kind="example"
	snippets={{
		javascript: `
<script>
  smartlook('record', { emails: false });
</script>
`,
	}}
/>

### On-page longer numbers

Use `record` with `{ numbers: true }` or `{ numbers: false }` attributes to start or stop recording of on-page numbers.

<Code
	kind="example"
	snippets={{
		javascript: `
<script>
  smartlook('record', { numbers: true });
</script>
`,
	}}
/>

<Code
	kind="example"
	snippets={{
		javascript: `
<script>
  smartlook('record', { numbers: false });
</script>
`,
	}}
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">
	{`
Numbers in format **\\d[\\d\\s\\-]{6}\\d** are being masked
`}

</TextBlock>

## Combining calls

You can combine these calls together like this:

<Code
	kind="example"
	snippets={{
		javascript: `
<script>
  smartlook('record', { forms: true, numbers: true, emails: false, ips: true });
</script>
`,
	}}
/>
