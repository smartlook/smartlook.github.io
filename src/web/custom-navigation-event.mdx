Custom navigation event allows for easy tracking of navigation event that happens without actual URL in address bar changing.

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
Using this API when the url in address bar is changing can result in unwanted URLs duplication in recordings
`}
</TextBlock>

Code you need to insert in your site has a following format in **JavaScript**.

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    javascript: `
<script>
  smartlook('navigation', url);
</script>
`,
  }}
/>

The `url` parameter can be either:
- full location (URL) of the page
- path portion of a URL that should start with a slash (/) character
