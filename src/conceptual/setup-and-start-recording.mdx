*This section deals with how to setup Smartlook SDK and start recording your app.*

To start recording, just put the following code into your application. Once you run your app on a device or in a simulator, recording will appear [in your dashboard](https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects).

In order to function properly, the setup should happen as soon as possible in the app life cycle:

<CodeBlock  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    android: {
      java: `
Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(String YOUR_API_KEY)
 
// TODO: notes when using this other method 
Smartlook.setup(String YOUR_API_KEY, Activity activity)
      `,
      kotlin: `
android kotlin snippet
      `,
      kotlin: `
android kotlin snippet
      `,
    },
    ios: {
      swift: `
include Smartlook
 
...
 
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
 
   Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
   Smartlook.startRecording()
}
      `,
      objc: `
#include Smartlook
 
...
 
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
 
   Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
   Smartlook.startRecording()
}      `,
    },
    react: {
      js: `
// Smartlook initialization
var Smartlook = require("smartlook-react-native-wrapper"); 
Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording("API_KEY");
      `,
    },
    ionic: {
      js: `
Ionic javascript
      `,
      typescript: `
Ionic typescript
      `,
    },
    cordova: {
      js: `
Cordova javascript
      `,
      typescript: `

      `,
    },
    xamarin: {
      csharp: `
Xamarin C#
      `,
    },
    unity: {
      csharp: `
Unity C#
      `,
    },
    unreal: {
      csharp: `
Unreal C#
      `,
    },
    cocos: {
      cpp: `
Cocos C++
      `,
      lua: `
Cocos lua
   `
   },
   flutter: {
      dart: `
      Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording('YOUR_API_KEY');
   `,
   }
  }}
/>

This is basically all you need to record your sessions. All other events in the app life cycle are handled by Smartlook automatically.

<Alert kind="important">
  It may take several minutes before the recordings appear in the Dashboard. In the default setup, recordings are not uploaded when the device is on a mobile network. In order to see the recordings immediately, make sure the device is on WiFi, or that mobile uploads are enabled in [your project dashboard](https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects). The recording is not streamed, it is uploaded in chunks and then processed on the server. To understand when your recordings will be availabe in the project dashboard, see <Link to="/conceptual/when-i-will-see-the-recordings-in-dashboard">this document</Link>.
</Alert>

<Alert kind="note" visibleOn="ios">
  When debugging your app with Smartlook, you will encounter a Main Thread Checker warning which might be accompanied by a short app freeze during the app start. The freeze does not happen in production builds. For details, see this [technical note](/cookbook/ios-main-thread-check-warning").
</Alert>

## Setup Options

Smartlook recording can be customized by several parameters. Some of the recording customization options can be set by dedicated methods, some others can be also set as startup options.
 
Not all options are available on all platforms. For a comprehensive list of all the setup options and related details, consult  our
