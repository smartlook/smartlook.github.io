# Setup & Start Recording

*This section deals with how to setup Smartlook SDK and start recording your app.*

To start recording, just put the following code into your application. Once you run your app on a device or in a simulator, recording will appear in your dashboard (link to the dashboard).

In order to function properly, the setup should happen as soon as possible in the app life cycle:

<CodeBlock
  snippets={{
    android: {
      java: `
Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(String YOUR_API_KEY)
 
// TODO: notes when using this other method 
Smartlook.setup(String YOUR_API_KEY, Activity activity)
      `,
      kotlin: `
android kotlin snippet
      `,
      kotlin: `
android kotlin snippet
      `,
    },
    ios: {
      swift: `
include Smartlook
 
...
 
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
 
   Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
   Smartlook.startRecording()
}
      `,
      objc: `
#include Smartlook
 
...
 
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
 
   Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
   Smartlook.startRecording()
}      `,
    },
    react: {
      js: `
// Smartlook initialization
var Smartlook = require("smartlook-react-native-wrapper"); 
Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording("API_KEY");
      `,
    },
    ionic: {
      js: `
Ionic javascript
      `,
      typescript: `
Ionic typescript
      `,
    },
    cordova: {
      js: `
Cordova javascript
      `,
      typescript: `
Cordova typescript
      `,
    },
    xamarin: {
      csharp: `
Xamarin C#
      `,
    },
    unity: {
      csharp: `
Unity C#
      `,
    },
    unreal: {
      csharp: `
Unreal C#
      `,
    },
    cocos: {
      cpp: `
Cocos C++
      `,
      lua: `
Cocos lua
   `
   },
   flutter: {
      dart: `
      Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording('YOUR_API_KEY');
   `,
   }
  }}
/>

This is basically all you need to record your sessions. All other events in the app life cycle are handled by Smartlook automatically.

Note: common startup issues: 

- it may take several minutes before the recordings appear in the Dashboard. The recording is not streamed, it is uploaded in chunks and then processed on the server. 
- in the default setup, recordings are not uploaded when the device is on a mobile network. In order to see the recordings immediately, please make sure the device is on WiFi (link to documentation & dashboard). 

<TextBlock visibleOn="ios">
  {(platform) => {
    return (
      <div>
         NOTE: When debugging your app with Smartlook, you will encounter a Main Thread Checker warning which might be accompanied by a short app freeze during the app start. The freeze does not happen in production builds. For details, see this <a href="/cookbook/ios-main-thread-check-warning">technical note</a>.
      </div>
    );
  }}
</TextBlock>

## Setup Options Overview
Smartlook recording could be customized by several parameters. Some of the recording customization options could be set by dedicated methods, some others can be only/also set as startup options.
 
Not all options are available on all platforms. For most options, there is also a dedicated method or property that can set it later in the app life-cycle.

For comprehensive list of all options and other details, consult [API reference](http://localhost:3000/api_reference/#setup-configuration).
