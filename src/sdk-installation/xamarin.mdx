<Title>Xamarin SDK Installation</Title>

1. **Add** [Smartlook Xamarin NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Smartlook/) to the project.

2. **Include** Smartlook into the respective source code, then **setup** and **start** it  

<Code
  snippets={{
    csharp: `
using Smartlook;
...
Smartlook.Analytics.SetupAndStart("API_KEY");
  `,
  }}
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
To setup Smartlook, the **unique project API key **is needed. It can be found in the mobile project settings in <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

The most straightforward way to run Smartlook is by setting and starting it up at the very begin of the app life cycle
- **iOS**: in `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` of the `AppDelegates` class
- **Android**: in `onCreate()` of the `Application` class

3. Smartlook now starts recording the application. The recordings will appear in the [Smartlook player](https://app.smartlook.com/) shortly.  

<TextBlock kind="important">

SDK will upload sessions **only on WiFi**. When uploading on mobile connections is requested, too, it must be enabled in the project settings in the dashboard. More details about the recording process can be found in the <Link to="/conceptual/when-the-recordings-appear-in-dashboard">Conceptual documentation</Link>.
