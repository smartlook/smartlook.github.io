# Installation

1. Install Smartlook Ionic native plugin:

<Code
  snippets={{
    cli: `
npm install @ionic-native/smartlook --save
`,
  }}
/>

2. Add Cordova plugin plugin to your project:

<Code
  snippets={{
    cli: `
ionic cordova plugin add https://github.com/smartlook/cordova-smartlook.git
`,
  }}
/>

3. Inject Smartlook SDK into `app.module.ts`:

<Code
  snippets={{
      typescript: `
import { Smartlook } from '@ionic-native/smartlook/ngx';\n
...\n
@NgModule({\n
    ...\n
    providers: [Smartlook, ...]\n
    ...
})
export class AppModule {}
      `,
  }}
/>

4. Import `Smartlook` and `SmartlookSetupConfig` into `app.component.ts` and setup the SDK in [platform ready](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v3/api/platform/Platform/#ready) callback:

<Code
  snippets={{
      typescript: `
import { Smartlook, SmartlookSetupConfig } from '@ionic-native/smartlook/ngx';\n
...\n
@Component( ... )
export class AppComponent {
    constructor(private smartlook: Smartlook) {
        this.platform.ready().then(() => {
            this.smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(new SmartlookSetupConfig("YOUR API KEY"));
        }
    }
}
      `,
  }}
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">

To setup Smartlook, the **unique project API key **is needed. It can be found in the mobile project settings in <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

5. Smartlook now starts recording the app. The recordings will appear in the [Smartlook player](https://app.smartlook.com/) shortly.  

<TextBlock kind="important">

SDK will upload sessions **only on WiFi**. When uploading on mobile connections is requested, it must be enabled in the project settings in the dashboard. More details about the recording process can be found in the <Link to="/conceptual/when-the-recordings-appear-in-dashboard">Conceptual documentation</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

# Supported versions
Current **minimal** supported version is **Jelly Bean (API 18)** for Android and **10** for iOS.

**Ionic framework 4.0 is needed** to support Ionic native plugins such as this one. 
If you are using older versions of Ionic framework and want to use Smartlook SDK, you can use our [Cordova SDK](/sdk-installation/cordova) directly.
