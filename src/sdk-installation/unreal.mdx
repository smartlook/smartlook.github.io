3. Close and reopen your Unreal project to load the Smartlook plugin.
4. Open Plugins settings (Edit - Plugins), make sure the Smartlook plugin is enabled. The Smartlook plugin can be found in the Installed section under Analytics.
5. Set analytics provider to `IOSSmartlook` (Edit - Project Settings - Analytics - Providers)
6. Obtain your SDK Key from the [Smartlook Dashboard](https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects) and insert it into the Smartlook Plugin settings (Edit - Project Settings - Analytics - Smartlook).
7. Enable recording by ticking the `Start Recording` switch in Smartlook Plugin settings, or by using `Start Session` analytics blueprint node, or by using:

  snippets={{
    ruby: `
FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->StartSession();
`,
  }}
/>

8. Record events with `Record Event` analytics blueprint node, or by using:
