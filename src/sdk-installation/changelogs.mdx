# Smartlook Mobile SDK Release Changelogs

This changelog shows all relevant releases for each platform.

<TextBlock kind="important" visibleOn="ios,react,cordova,ionic,cocos">
{`
Standard iOS SDK is linked as a Cocopoad dependency to React Native, Cordova, Ionic and Cocos plugins. \n
This means, that the bugfixes in the latest standard iOS SDK release propagate to all respective frameworks as well.\n
New API methods, however, must wait for the respective platfrom plugin update.
