# Smartlook Mobile SDK Release Changelogs

This changelog shows all relevant releases for each platform.

<TextBlock kind="important" visibleOn="react,cordova,ionic,cocos,flutter">
{`
Standard iOS/Android SDK is linked as a Cocopoad/Gradle dependency to React Native, Cordova, Ionic and Cocos plugins. \n
This means, that the bugfixes in the latest standard iOS/Android SDK release propagate to all respective frameworks as well.\n
New API methods, however, must wait for the respective platfrom plugin update.

## Android SDK [1.8.1] - 2021-06-07
\n
### Fixed

\n
***`}</TextBlock>



<TextBlock visibleOn="android">{`
## Android SDK [1.8.0] - 2021-05-31
\n
In this release, we have completely reworked our upload mechanism. SDK now uses system jobs. This change has many advantages over the old upload mechanism:
- Offline recordings are uploaded as soon as there is a suitable network connection (Wi-Fi or mobile connection if the project has enabled mobile uploads). This means the application doesn’t have to run for the upload to happen.
- Uploads happen in batches, this ensures lower battery usage.
- SDK now uses fewer API calls.
\n
Internal SDK packages were reworked, which means you might need to migrate some imports when upgrading from an older version. Please follow the <Link to="/docs/sdk/cookbooks/android_1_8_0_migration">migration guide</Link> for more details.
\n
### Changed:
- Sensitive views are now overlayed with a “texture” (instead of a single color). This greatly improves recording visuals. And makes sensitive views distinguishable on theme changes (dark/light).
- \`UserProperties\` helper class now works as a “builder”. Thus put methods can be “linked” together like this:
<Code
  snippets={{
    javascript: \`
new UserProperties()
    .putEmail("sample@mail.com")
    .putName("Sample Name");
\`,
}}
/>   
- SDK now uses \`AndroidX\` as default dependencies, but the “support” version is still available.
- SDK targets the latest (at the time of release) \`Android API 30\`.
\n
### Fixed
- Rendering modes and touch detection take \`z-index\` and elevation into account.
- Sensitive view hiding tweaks (mainly for \`WebView\` hiding) and minor API fixes (whitelisting).
- Stability improvements and various bug fixes (new internal logic).
- This release internally uses latest backend API, that hugely improves on stability and reliability.
