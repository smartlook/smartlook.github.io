<Title>Unity SDK Installation</Title>

## Installation for Android - AAR

1. Download [Smartlook Android Unity SDK v1.8.7](https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/app-1.8.7-unity-support.aar).
2. Put `AAR` file to `Assets/Plugins/Android` in your Unity project.
3. Get a Unity bridge from [our Github repository](https://github.com/smartlook/unity-bridge).

## Installation for Android - Gradle

In case there is a conflict with other libraries, we also released a lite version of the SDK. This solution however needs to be implemented via gradle of the app itself. Steps are described below. Flow is similar to integration of our native SDK.

1. Add Smartlook in your **appâ€™s** `build.gradle`:

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    gradle: `
implementation 'com.smartlook.recording:app:1.6.2-unity-lite'
`,
  }}
/>

2. Add Smartlook Maven repository in your **projects** `build.gradle`:

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    gradle: `
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/release"
    }
  }
}
`,
  }}
/>

3. In case you are missing some of the dependencies, feel free to add:

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    gradle: `
implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8:1.3.61'
`,
  }}
/>

4. Get a Unity bridge from [our Github repository](https://github.com/smartlook/unity-bridge).

## Installation for iOS

1. Download [Smartlook iOS Unity SDK v1.5.0](https://sdk.smartlook.com/ios/smartlook-unity-ios-sdk-1.5.0.165.zip).
2. Unzip the archive and put `SmartlookUnity.framework` to `Assets/Plugins/iOS` in your Unity project.
3. Get a Unity bridge from [our Github repository](https://github.com/smartlook/unity-bridge).

## Unity Jar Resolver

Currently this option is still in progress - Please let us know if this is somehow a blocking issue to you.

# Supported versions
Currently the **minimal** supported Android version is **Jelly Bean (API 18)**, however **video is recorded only for API 24+**, analytics events and functionalities are not limited.

Smartlook Unity iOS SDK works with Metal graphics API only. OpenGL is not supported at the moment.

# Start Recording

To start recording (or just to setup the SDK), you can use i.e.:

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    csharp: `
public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        SmartlookUnity.SetupOptionsBuilder builder = new SmartlookUnity.SetupOptionsBuilder("API_KEY");
        SmartlookUnity.Smartlook.SetupAndStartRecording(builder.Build());
    }
\n
    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        ...
    }
}
`,
  }}
/>

<Alert kind="important">
To setup Smartlook, you will need your unique API key. This can be found in your mobile project settings in <a href="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">your Smartlook Dashboard</a>.
</Alert>

<TextBlock kind="important">

SDK will upload sessions **only on Wi-Fi**. When uploading on mobile connections is requested, it must be enabled in the project settings in the dashboard.
