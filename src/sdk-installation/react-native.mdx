# Smartlook SDK React Native Installation

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
**Managed Expo apps can't be supported** due to the explicit technical restrictions imposed by Expo. For details, see [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/introduction/faq/), the FAQ "_How do I add custom native code to my Expo project?_". Smartlook functionality must be implemented in the native code.
`}
</TextBlock>


1. Install the Smartlook RN bridge

<Code
  snippets={{
      npm: `
npm install smartlook-react-native-wrapper --save
`,
      yarn: `  
yarn add smartlook-react-native-wrapper 
`,
    }
  }
/>

2. Add dependency on native Smartlook SDK

*Android* 

* Open `android/build.gradle` 
* Update gradle version to `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.0'` in case you are using older React native version
* Add our maven repository:

<Code
  snippets={{
      gradle: `
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/release"
    }
  }
}
`,
    }
  }
/>

Also edit `gradle-wrapper.properties` so you are using: `gradle-4.4-all.zip`. This step is not needed in newer React native versions. 

*iOS*

Smartlook native library is installed as a **Cocoapods dependency**. 

There are no manual steps required, just make sure your Cocoapod dependecies are up-to-date after Smartlook RN installation dependecy.

3. Import Smartlook, setup it and start recording

<Code
  snippets={{
      javascript: `
var Smartlook = require('smartlook-react-native-wrapper');
Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording("KEY");
`,
    }
  }
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
To setup Smartlook, the **unique project API key **is needed. It can be found in the mobile project settings in <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

4. Smartlook now starts recording the app. The recordings will appear in the [Smartlook player](https://app.smartlook.com/) shortly.  

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
SDK will upload sessions **only on WiFi**. When uploading on mobile connections is requested, it must be enabled in the project settings in the dashboard. More details about the recording process can be found in the <Link to="/conceptual/when-the-recordings-appear-in-dashboard">Conceptual documentation</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>
