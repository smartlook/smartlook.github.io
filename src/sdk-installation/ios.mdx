<Title>iOS SDK Installation</Title>

## Installation

There are three ways to integrate Smartlook into your app:

### 1. Swift Package Manager

Add this Swift Package â€“ `https://github.com/smartlook/SmartlookSwiftPackage`.

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
If you experience \"**Found an unexpected Mach-O header code: 0x72613c2**\" error when uploading an archived app to the App Store, please follow <Link to="/docs/sdk/cookbooks/swift-package-app-store-mach-o-error">this guide</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

### 2. Direct integration

Smartlook can also be added directly to the app project by **downloading** our latest [Smartlook iOS SDK (1.8.0)](https://sdk.smartlook.com/ios/smartlook-ios-sdk-1.8.0.7.zip), unzipping the file, and adding `Smartlook.xcframework` to the Xcode project.

### 3. Cocoapods 

In projects that use **Cocoapods**, Smartlook can be installed by adding the respective pod into `Podfile`:

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    ruby: `
pod Smartlook
`,
  }}
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
Please note that up-to-date Cocopoads version is necessary to build and run applications with Smartlook on computers with Apple Silicon (M1 and later) chips.
`}
</TextBlock>

## Setup and Start Recording

To **setup** and **start** recording with Smartlook, Smartlook must be imported and configured, e.g., in `AppDelegate` and its `didFinishLaunching` method:

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
      swift: `
import Smartlook\n
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
  let smartlookConfig = Smartlook.SetupConfiguration(key: "API_KEY")
  Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(configuration: smartlookConfig)
  // other initialization stuff
  return true
}
      `,
      'objective-c': `
#import <Smartlook/Smartlook.h>\n
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  SLSetupConfiguration *slConfig = [[SLSetupConfiguration alloc] initWithKey:@"API_KEY"];
  [Smartlook setupAndStartRecordingWithConfiguration:slConfig];
  // other initialization stuff
  return YES;
}
      `,
    }
  }
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
To setup Smartlook, the **unique project API key **is needed. It can be found in the mobile project settings in the <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

Smartlook now starts recording the app. The recordings will appear in the [Smartlook player](https://app.smartlook.com/) shortly.

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
When starting in debug mode, your iOS app may **stop for a few seconds after this it will start and print a warning** when Smartlook is included.  
It is caused by **Xcode's Main Thread Checker** diagnostics. Read more about why it happens and how to handle it in this <Link to="/docs/sdk/cookbooks/ios-main-thread-check-warning">Technical Note</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
SDK will upload sessions **only on WiFi**. When uploading on mobile connections is requested, too, it must be enabled in the project settings in the dashboard. More details about the recording process can be found in the <Link to="/docs/sdk/conceptual/when-the-recordings-appear-in-dashboard">Conceptual documentation</Link>.

</TextBlock>
