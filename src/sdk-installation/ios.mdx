# iOS SDK Installation

1. In projects that use **Cocoapods**, Smartlook can be installed by adding the respective pod into `Podfile`:

<Code
  snippets={{
    ruby: `
pod Smartlook
`,
  }}
/>

Smartlook can be also added directly to the app project by **downloading** the latest [Smartlook iOS SDK](https://sdk.smartlook.com/ios/smartlook-ios-sdk-1.2.5.59.zip), unzipping the file and adding `Smartlook.framework` to the Xcode project.

2. To **setup** and **start** recording with Smartlook, Smartlook must be imported and configured e.g., in `AppDelegate` and its `didFinishLaunching` method:

<Code
  snippets={{
      swift: `
import Smartlook
...
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n
    Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY")
    Smartlook.startRecording()
      `,
      'objective-c': `
#import <Smartlook/Smartlook.h>
...
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n    
    [Smartlook setupWithKey: @"YOUR_API_KEY"];
    [Smartlook startRecording];
      `,
    }
  }
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
To setup Smartlook, the **unique project API key **is needed. It can be found in the mobile project settings in <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

3. Smartlook now starts recording the app. The recordings will appear in the [Smartlook player](https://app.smartlook.com/) shortly.  

<TextBlock kind="important">

SDK will upload sessions **only on WiFi**. When uploading on mobile connections is requested, too, it must be enabled in the project settings in the dashboard. More details about the recording process can be found in the <Link to="/conceptual/when-the-recordings-appear-in-dashboard">Conceptual documentation</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>
