<Title>Flutter SDK Installation</Title>

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
The Smartlook plugin for flutter was renamed. It's now called <Link to="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_smartlook">flutter_smartlook</Link>.
Please update the dependency name in your pubspec.yaml as well as imports.
`}
</TextBlock>

<TextBlock kind="note">
{`We are introducing the all-new wireframing mode in the version \`3.0.0\`, where we are the only ones who support functionality like this on Flutter.`}
</TextBlock>

1. Add Smartlook among other dependencies into the `pubspec.yaml`

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    yaml: `
dependencies:
  flutter_smartlook:
`,
  }}
/>

2. Setup Smartlook and start recording, e.g., in your app state initialization

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    dart: `
import 'package:flutter_smartlook/flutter_smartlook.dart';\n
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
	@override
	void initState() {
		super.initState();
		...
		SetupOptions options = (
                    new SetupOptionsBuilder('API_KEY')
                  ).build();
                Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(options);
		...
	  }
}
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SmartlookHelperWidget(
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Flutter App',
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
`,
  }}
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
To setup Smartlook, the **unique project API key **is needed. It can be found in the mobile project settings in the <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

3. Smartlook now starts recording the app. The recordings will appear in the [Smartlook player](https://app.smartlook.com/) shortly.

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
SDK will upload sessions **only on Wi-Fi**. When uploading on mobile connections is requested, it must be enabled in the project settings in the dashboard. More details about the recording process can be found in the <Link to="/docs/sdk/conceptual/when-the-recordings-appear-in-dashboard">Conceptual documentation</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>
