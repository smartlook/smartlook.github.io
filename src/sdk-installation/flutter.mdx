1. Add Smartlook among other dependecies into the `pubspec.yaml`

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    yaml: `
dependencies:
  smartlook:
`,
  }}
/>

2. Setup Smartlook and start recording, e.g., in your app state initiacization

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    dart: `
import 'package:smartlook/smartlook.dart';\n
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
	@override
	void initState() {
		super.initState();
		...
		Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording('API_KEY');
		...
	  }
}`,
  }}
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">

To setup Smartlook, the **unique project API key **is needed. It can be found in the mobile project settings in <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}

3. Smartlook now starts recording the app. The recordings will appear in the [Smartlook player](https://app.smartlook.com/) shortly.
