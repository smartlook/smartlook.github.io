<Title>Cocos SDK Installation</Title>

## Android

1. Add Smartlook in your **app’s** `build.gradle`:

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    gradle: `
implementation 'com.smartlook.recording:app:1.6.2-cocos'
`,
  }}
/>

2. Add Smartlook Maven repository in your **projects** `build.gradle`:

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    gradle: `
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/release"
    }
  }
}
`,
  }}
/>

3.Setup and start Smartlook in **onCreate()** of your **Application** class:

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
      java: `
public class AppActivity extends Cocos2dxActivity {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        ...
        // DO OTHER INITIALIZATION BELOW
        Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(YOUR_API_KEY);
    }
}
      `,
      kotlin: `
class AppActivity : Cocos2dxActivity() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        ...
        // DO OTHER INITIALIZATION BELOW
        Smartlook.setupAndStartRecording(YOUR_API_KEY)
    }
}
      `,
  }}
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
To setup Smartlook, the **unique project API key **is needed. It can be found in the mobile project settings in <Link to="https://app.smartlook.com/settings/projects">Smartlook Dashboard</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

4. Smartlook now starts recording the app. The recordings will appear in the [Smartlook player](https://app.smartlook.com/) shortly.

<TextBlock kind="important">
{`
SDK will upload sessions **only on WiFi**. When uploading on mobile connections is requested, it must be enabled in the project settings in the dashboard. More details about the recording process can be found in the <Link to="/docs/sdk/conceptual/when-the-recordings-appear-in-dashboard">Conceptual documentation</Link>.
`}
</TextBlock>

## iOS

1. In projects that use **Cocoapods**, Smartlook can be installed by adding the respective pod into `Podfile`:

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
    ruby: `
pod Smartlook
`,
  }}
/>

Smartlook can be also added directly to the app project by **downloading** the latest [Smartlook iOS SDK](https://sdk.smartlook.com/ios/smartlook-ios-sdk-1.5.0.2607.zip), unzipping the file and adding `Smartlook.framework` to the Xcode project.

2. To **setup** and **start** recording with Smartlook, Smartlook must be imported and configured e.g., in `AppDelegate` and its `didFinishLaunching`:

<Code
  kind="example"
  snippets={{
      swift: `
import Smartlook
...
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {\n
    Smartlook.setup(key: "YOUR_API_KEY", options: [.useAdaptiveFramerate: false]))
    Smartlook.startRecording()
      `,
      'objective-c': `
#import <Smartlook/Smartlook.h>
...
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {\n
    [Smartlook setupWithKey: @"YOUR_API_KEY" options:@{SLSetupOptionUseAdaptiveFramerateKey: @NO }];
    [Smartlook startRecording];
      `,
    }
  }
/>

<TextBlock kind="important">
