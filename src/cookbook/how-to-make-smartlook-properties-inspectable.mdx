Inspectable properties of visual elements used in Xcode Design Builder enable quick code-less editing of their values. 

Unfortunatelly, properties exported from an external framework like Smartlook cannot be directly attributed as `IBInspectable` to enable this functionality.

There is, however, a neat straigthforward workaround to enable this functionality by wrapping the Smartlook properties in own inspectable properties via a custom `UIView` extension:

<Code
	snippets={{
		swift: `
extension UIView {
    @IBInspectable var smartlookSensitive: Bool {
        get { return slSensitive }
        set { slSensitive = newValue }
    }
}`,
	}}
/>

By adding this code to your app, a wrapper is created around Smartlook's `slSensitive` property that publishes its value to Interface Builder as `smartlookSensitive`. You can indeed use another name for the new inspectable property so it fits your code naming conventions.
