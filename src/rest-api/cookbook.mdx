# Deeplink to the visitor detail
1. Fetch detail using our REST API (https://api.smartlook.cloud/api/v1/visitors/search, check out the [API reference](/docs/rest-api/reference))
2. Get the `visitorId` from the response
3. Get `projectId` and `organizationId` from your dashboard URL
4. Now you can build the URL to the visitor detail as follows: `https://app.smartlook.com/org/{organizationId}/project/{projectId}/recordings?visitor={visitorId}`


# Delete identified visitors
There are 2 endpoints to delete visitors and their related events and sessions
1. Delete only 1 visitor by `visitorId` (unique ID obtained by Smartlook) - this `visitorId` fill in to the path `/api/v1/visitors/{visitorId}`
