### A note to _Main Thread Checker_ warning

When debugging your app with Smartlook, you will encounter a `Main Thread Checker` warning which might be accompanied by a short app freeze during the app start. The freeze does not happen in production builds. For details, see [this technical note](#a-technical-note-main-thread-checker-warning).

## Installation

Install via CocoaPods or download Smartlook iOS SDK.

You need to provide your **SDK Key** which can be found in [Smartlook Dashboard](https://www.smartlook.com/app/dashboard/settings/projects){:target="_blank"}.
{: .alert .alert-warning }

### Cocoapods installation

1. Add `pod 'Smartlook'` to your project's Podfile.
2. Run `pod install`
3. Import Smartlook SDK in your app's App Delegate class:
```swift
import Smartlook
```
```objc
#import <Smartlook/Smartlook.h>
```
4. Run Smartlook by calling either `start` or `initialize` in your AppDelegate as described below.

### Manual installation

1. Download [Smartlook iOS SDK v1.0.0](https://sdk.smartlook.com/ios/smartlook-ios-sdk-1.0.0.zip) directly.
2. Unzip the file and add Smartlook.framework to your Xcode project.
3. Import Smartlook SDK in your app's App Delegate class:
```swift
import Smartlook
```
```objc
#import <Smartlook/Smartlook.h>
```
4. Run Smartlook by calling either `start` or `initialize` in your AppDelegate as described below.

## API Reference

Applications can interact with the SDK using public SDK methods.

You need to provide your **SDK Key** which can be found in [Smartlook Dashboard](https://www.smartlook.com/app/dashboard/settings/projects){:target="_blank"}.

### Run Smartlook

The typical way to initialize and start recording with Smartlook is by calling 

```swift
Smartlook.start(withKey: "your-app-sdk-key")
```
```objc
[Smartlook startWithKey:@"your-app-sdk-key"];
```

This method should be called as soon as the app starts in its `AppDelegate` `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.

That is all. 

There is no need to manually stop or pause recording when the app gets suspended by the user by pressing Home button or switching to another app, or restart recording when the app wakes up. This happens automatically.
{: .callout .callout-info }

### Initialize Smartlook to start it later

If you do not want to start recording immediately with the app start (you want, e.g., recording only some parts of the app), you still should initialise Smartlook as soon as possible. To do it, call

```swift
Smartlook.initialize(withKey: "your-app-sdk-key")
```
```objc
[Smartlook initializeWithKey:@"your-app-sdk-key"];
```

This method should be called as soon as the app starts in its `AppDelegate` `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.

Then, Smartlook is ready to start recording later with `resumeRecording` method. 

### Recording pausing and resuming

Regardless how is Smartlook initialised, it is always possible to pause/resume the recording, and check if the recording is active.  

```swift
Smartlook.resumeRecording() // start or resume paused recording
Smartlook.pauseRecording()  // pause recorging
Smartlook.isPaused()        // returns true/false
```
```objc
[Smartlook resumeRecording] // start or resume paused recording
[Smartlook pauseRecording]  // pause recorging
[Smartlook isPaused]        // returns true/false
```

It is harmless to call the methods in unruly order (e.g., to _resume_ while already recording).

There is no need to manually stop or pause recording when the app gets suspended by the user by pressing Home button or switching to another app, or restart recording when the app wakes up. This happens automatically.
{: .callout .callout-info }

### Initialize Smartlook with framerate options

The default framerate of Smartlook screen recording is **1Â frame per second** (fps). 

By our experience, this framerate is quite sufficient for capturing user behaviour for analytics purposes. 

If you need *smoother* recordings, use optional `framerate` attribute of the `startWithKey` and `initializeWithKey` methods to increase the framerate. 

Higher framerates do not necessarily lead to bigger video data, but more frequent screen capture increases the device CPU/GPU load and energy consumption. Compromise strategy could be e.g., enabling higher framerate during beta-testing, and decrease it to the default value in production builds.

```swift
Smartlook.start(withKey: "your-app-sdk-key", framerate: 3)       // initialize and start with custom framerate
Smartlook.initialize(withKey: "your-app-sdk-key", framerate: 3)  // just initialize with custom framerate
```
```objc
[Smartlook startWithKey:@"your-app-sdk-key" framerate:3];        // initialize and start with custom framerate
[Smartlook initializeWithKey:@"your-app-sdk-key" framerate:3];   // just initialize with custom framerate
```

### Mark and unmark sensitive views

You can mark views that preset sensitive information to be hidden from recordings. Text input fields (`UITextView`, `UITextField`) and Web views (`UIWebView`, `WKWebView`) are hidden by default. `SafariServices` and `AuthenticationServices` web views show as empty screens. 

To flag or unflag an `UIView` instance as sensitive, use its `BOOL slSensitive` property. To set custom overlay colour of a sensitive view, use its `UIColor slOverlay` property.

Both `slSensitive` and `slOverlay` properties are also accessible in Xcode Interface Builder.

Alternatively, legacy methods `markViewAsSensitive`, `unmarkViewAsSensitive` and `overlayColor` property can be also used to work with sensitive views.

### Record custom events

You can add custom events. Those events will be shown in your Dashboard. Smartlook records some events automatically (button presses, screens opening). Properties in the dictionary must be strings and values must be strings as well. Other values (like arrays, nested dictionaries) will be _stringified_.

```swift
Smartlook.recordCustomEvent(withEventName: "user-bought-subscription", propertiesDictionary: ["tier" : "basic"]);
```
```objc
[Smartlook recordCustomEventWithEventName:@"user-bought-subscription" propertiesDictionary:@{ @"tier" : @"basic" } ]
```

### Add duration to custom events

Custom events can also have duration. In order to record it, call first
```swift
Smartlook.startCustomEvent(withEventName: "user-bought-subscription", propertiesDictionary: ["tier" : "basic"]);
```
```objc
[Smartlook startCustomEventWithEventName:@"user-bought-subscription" propertiesDictionary:@{ @"tier" : @"basic" } ]
```

This method does not record an event. It is the subsequent `recordCustomEvent` call with the same `eventName` that does. 
{: .callout .callout-info } 

In the resulting event, the property dictionaries of `start` and `record` are merged (the `record` values override the `start` ones if the key is the same).

The `duration` is shown as a property of the event, too.

### Add user identifier

User identifier can be specified for each recording session. This identifier can be then used in Smartlook Dashboard to lookup the recordings.

```swift
Smartlook.setUserIdentifier("some-user-identifier");
```
```objc
[Smartlook  setUserIdentifier:@"some-user-identifier"];
```

### Add other user properties

Additional custom information can be set for recording sessions, such as name, email and such. You'll see those properties in the Dashboard in Visitor details. Keys and values in the dictionary are expected to be Strings.

Keys **"name"** and **"email"** will be highlighted in Visitor information.
{: .callout .callout-info }

```swift
Smartlook.setUserPropertiesDictionary([
  "name" : "some-name", 
  "email" : "some-email",
  "some-other-property" : "some-other-value"
]);
```
```objc
[
  Smartlook setUserPropertiesDictionary:@{ 
    @"name" : @"some-name", 
    @"email" : @"some-email", 
    @"some-other-property" : @"some-other-value"
  }
]
```

### Crashlytics integration

When Crashlytics are setup in your app, Smartlook automatically adds a custom `SMARTLOOK SESSION URL` key to crash reports. Its value is URL of the latest recording made by Smartlook during or before the crash.

## A technical note: "Main Thread Checker" warning

When debugging your app with Smartlook, you will encounter a warning which title reads

`Main Thread Checker: UI API called on a background thread: -[UIView drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:]`

The warning is harmless, and is caused by capturing screen on background. The alternative (capturing the screenshot on the main thread) may cause glitches of the app UI - so having it this way and having this warning is a necessary trade-off to enable recording functionality.

This warning also might be accompanied by a short freeze of the app. This freeze does not happen in production builds, and is caused by an Xcode debug option. This option can be switched off in the respective run scheme diagnostic options:
