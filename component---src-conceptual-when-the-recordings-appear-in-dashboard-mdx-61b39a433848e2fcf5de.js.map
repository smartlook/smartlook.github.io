Also, when the application is closed on the device, the active session lives for a few more minutes before the data is processed. We also wait for a short period of time to be sure the application is really suspended for good, that it was not just a short interruption of the application by an incoming call or notification. In such a case of just a short interruption, Smartlook continues with recording into the active session once the application is active again.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Once the session is wrapped up, it moves to the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`All visitors`}</strong>{` tab.`}</p>\n    <h1 {...{\n      \"id\": \"data-uploading\"\n    }}>{`Data Uploading`}</h1>\n    <p>{`The frequency in which the data is gathered and sent depends on several factors.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Events data are recorded almost synchronously as they happen.
