Further details are provided in <Link to="/docs/sdk/conceptual/screen-recording-quality">Screen Recording Quality</Link>.\n\n\nThe level of recorded visual details is given by the rendering mode. The default mode is **native**, when Smartlook takes screenshots of the device screen, removes sensitive data from it and then composes video out of it.
